Prerequisites:
- DirectX 9.0c or later installed.

Steps to run the software:
- Compile all the projects.
- Go to GigaRender\Dist folder
- First run TerraGen_d.exe which builds a default test map of the size 4096x4096
- The TerraGen program will produce 5 files:
	- HeightMap.bmp (a gray scale image that represents the height map)
	- Texture.bmp (a colored image containing texture information)
	- major (a binary file that describes the map size, vertex spacing, ..) [REQUIRED]
	- map (a binary file that holds the geomerty data of the terrain preprocessed
	 and optimized for GigaRender streaming) [REQUIRED]
	- textures (a binary file that holds a preprocessed and optimized version of 
	 terrain texture) [REQUIRED]
- Within GigaRender\Dist folder create a Resources sub-folder.
- Within GigaRender\Dist\Resources create a map0 sub-folder.
- Copy the 3 required generated files (major, map, and textures) to the map0 folder
- Go back to GigaRender\Dist folder
- Run GigaRender_d.exe
