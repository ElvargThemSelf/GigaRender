# Introduction
GigaRender implements graphics content streaming optimized for terrain data(geometry + textures) between hard disk and graphics card memory with staging through the system memory to provide seamless display of large scenes.
The project allows scenes with large graphical content (e.g. Big Cities) to run on lower/normal computer configurations using the technique of load-on-demand, where only the visible parts of the scene are loaded into the video memory from the hard-drive.
he loading process is done transparently in background threads.
