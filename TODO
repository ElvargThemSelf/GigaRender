- Loading priorities algorithm implementation (50%).
- physics data streaming.
- Cracks between different LODs.
- display statistics about loading\unloding memory usage
- implement different determine-working-set algorithms (33%)
- adding objects to the scene.
- re-implement TerraGen using the StreamReader functionality in the Utility Lib.
- automate the following constants:
	#define PATCH_TEXTURE_WIDTH 256
	#define PATCH_TEXTURE_HEIGHT 256
- moving into DirectX 10.
- rename TerrainPager	>>	ResourceManager.
- you might consider adding an resource eviction mechanism that won't immediatly remove the
 unsed-resource from the memory in the hope that this resource will be demanded again.
- add functionaliy that allows u to estimate the size of loaded textures (review
 ContentStreaming sample).
- consider using the DDS file format without depending on the D3DX functionality.
- Consider using Memory Mapped File IO.
- Do a more clever copying from MainMemory to VideoMemory. for Texture Copying you may
still specify only one copy operation per frame, but for lod fetching you may perfrom
multiple copy operations upon ready lods (espcially lods with low resolution).
