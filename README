== GigaRender ==

GigaRender implements graphics content streaming optimized for terrain
data(geometry + textures) between hard disk and graphics card memory 
with staging through the system memory to provide seamless display of
large scenes. The project allows scenes with large graphical content 
(e.g. Big Cities) to run on lower/normal computer configurations using
the technique of load-on-demand, where only the visible parts of the 
scene are loaded into the video memory from the hard-drive. The loading
process is done transparently in background threads.
